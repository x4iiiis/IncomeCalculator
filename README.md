# Income Calculator

[Project Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/l9aSfqFc/income-calculator-app "Income Calculator App | Trello")

A personal Java application that I use to track my wages vs direct debits and taxes, as well as monitoring my loose change (AKA 'shrapnel').

It is build to utilise a combination of XML and CSV parsing. This wasn't necessary; I just wanted to be able to say I had used XML before. Now I can!
